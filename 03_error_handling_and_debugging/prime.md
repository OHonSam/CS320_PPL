**Issues:**
- **Off-by-one error**: The loop for `i in 2..n` includes `n` itself, which incorrectly causes `n % n == 0` to return false for all `n > 1`. It should check up to `n-1` or, more efficiently, up to the square root of `n`.
- **Performance bottleneck**: Checking all numbers up to `n` is `O(n)`, whereas checking up to `sqrt(n)` is `O(sqrt(n))`.
- **Syntax error**: The `true` return statement is not properly indented under the `for` loop, potentially causing confusion (though Rubyâ€™s `end` mitigates this).
- **Edge case handling**: The check `n <= 1` correctly handles non-positive numbers, but negative numbers should also be explicitly addressed for clarity.

**Explanation:**
The program intends to check if a number is prime but inefficiently checks divisibility up to `n` and includes `n` itself in the check, leading to incorrect results. The performance can be improved by limiting the loop to `sqrt(n)`, and the logic should exclude `n` from divisibility checks.

**Corrected Code:**
```ruby
def is_prime(n)
  return false if n <= 1
  (2..Math.sqrt(n)).each do |i|
    return false if n % i == 0
  end
  true
end
```

**Improvements:**
- Changed loop to `(2..Math.sqrt(n))` for `O(sqrt(n))` complexity.
- Used `each` for idiomatic Ruby iteration.
- Properly indented and structured for clarity.
