You're right to call this a **buggy Golang code snippet** — let's go through it step by step.

---

### ✅ **Your Goal**

You want to implement **binary search**, and **measure its performance** by running it 100,000 times.

---

### 🔍 **Bug Analysis**

Here’s the line causing the issue:

```go
result = binarysearch(arr, x)
```

But you’ve defined the function as:

```go
func binarySearch(arr []int, x int) int
```

### ❌ What's wrong?

- **Bug:** Mismatched function name: `binarysearch` vs `binarySearch`
- **Type of error:** **Compile-time error** (specifically, a **syntax/identifier resolution** error)
- **Explanation:** Go is case-sensitive. You defined `binarySearch` (with uppercase `S`), but called `binarysearch` (with lowercase `s`). This will result in a "undefined: binarysearch" compile error.

---

### ✅ **Fix**

Update this line:

```go
result = binarysearch(arr, x)
```

to:

```go
result = binarySearch(arr, x)
```

---

### 🛠 Bonus: Additional Improvements

Let’s check the binary search logic too.

Here’s your loop condition:

```go
for left < right
```

This is **slightly off**. A **correct binary search** should use:

```go
for left <= right
```

Otherwise, you may miss the last element. Let me explain:

- Suppose `left == right`, it means there’s **1 element left to check**.
- But `left < right` will skip this case.

### ✅ Fix the loop condition:

```go
for left <= right
```

### 🧠 Final Fixed Version

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func binarySearch(arr []int, x int) int {
	left := 0
	right := len(arr) - 1

	for left <= right {
		mid := left + (right-left)/2

		if arr[mid] == x {
			return mid
		}

		if arr[mid] < x {
			left = mid + 1
		} else {
			right = mid - 1
		}
	}

	return -1
}

func main() {
	arr := []int{2, 3, 4, 10, 40, 50, 70, 85, 90, 100}
	x := 40

	start := time.Now()

	const iterations = 100000
	var result int
	for i := 0; i < iterations; i++ {
		result = binarySearch(arr, x)
	}

	duration := time.Since(start)

	if result != -1 {
		fmt.Printf("Element %d is present at index %d\n", x, result)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("Element %d is not present in array\n", x)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Binary search executed %d times\n", iterations)
	fmt.Printf("Total time: %v\n", duration)
	fmt.Printf("Average time per search: %v\n", duration/time.Duration(iterations))
}
```

### ✅ Summary

| Issue | Type | Fix |
|------|------|-----|
| Wrong function name `binarysearch` | Syntax | Use `binarySearch` |
| Incorrect loop condition `left < right` | Logic | Use `left <= right` |

Let me know if you want to convert it to a recursive version, add error logging, or benchmark other search algorithms too!
