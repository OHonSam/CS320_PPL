**Issues:**
- **Indentation error**: The `solve` call is incorrectly indented, though Ruby’s parser handles this; it affects readability.
- **Non-idiomatic range**: `0...n` is correct but less common than `0..(n-1)` or `n.times`.
- **Logic error**: In `solve`, the `return false` inside the `for` loop causes the function to exit after checking the first column, preventing backtracking. It should be outside or removed.
- **Logic error**: In `safe?`, checking `board[i][i]` looks at the diagonal incorrectly; it should check diagonals relative to `(row, col)`.
- **Logic error**: The backtracking in `solve` doesn’t handle the case where placing a queen fails; it resets the board but doesn’t try other columns.
- **Output format**: `board.map { |row| row.join }` assumes a single solution, but N-Queens typically returns all solutions or a formatted board.

**Explanation:**
The N-Queens solver fails to find solutions due to premature termination in `solve` and incorrect diagonal checks in `safe?`. The backtracking logic is incomplete, and the output format may not meet expectations for multiple solutions.

**Corrected Code:**
```ruby
def solve_n_queens(n)
  board = Array.new(n) { Array.new(n, '.') }
  solutions = []
  solve(board, 0, n, solutions)
  solutions.map { |sol| sol.map { |row| row.join } }
end

def solve(board, row, n, solutions)
  return solutions << board.map { |r| r.dup } if row == n
  n.times do |col|
    if safe?(board, row, col, n)
      board[row][col] = 'Q'
      solve(board, row + 1, n, solutions)
      board[row][col] = '.'
    end
  end
end

def safe?(board, row, col, n)
  (0...row).each do |i|
    return false if board[i][col] == 'Q'
    return false if (col - (row - i)) >= 0 && board[i][col - (row - i)] == 'Q'
    return false if (col + (row - i)) < n && board[i][col + (row - i)] == 'Q'
  end
  true
end
```

**Improvements:**
- Added solutions array to collect all valid boards.
- Removed premature return false in `solve`.
- Fixed diagonal checks in `safe?` to examine both diagonals correctly.
- Used `n.times` for idiomatic iteration.
- Ensured proper backtracking by resetting the board only after recursive calls.
