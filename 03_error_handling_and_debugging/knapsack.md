**Issues:**
- **Syntax error**: Missing closing parenthesis in `def knapsack(values, weights, capacity`.
- **Off-by-one error**: The loop for `i in 0..n` accesses `values[i]` and `weights[i]` at `i == n`, causing an index error. It should be `0...n` or `1..n` with proper indexing.
- **Initialization error**: `dp = Array.new(n) { Array.new(capacity, 0) }` uses `capacity` for columns, but it should be `capacity + 1` to include `w == capacity`.
- **Missing return**: The final `dp[n][capacity]` is not explicitly returned (though Ruby implicitly returns it).

**Explanation:**
The knapsack algorithm fails due to a syntax error in the function definition and an off-by-one error in the loop, causing index errors. The DP table initialization is also incorrect, as it doesnâ€™t account for the full capacity range.

**Corrected Code:**
```ruby
def knapsack(values, weights, capacity)
  n = values.length
  dp = Array.new(n + 1) { Array.new(capacity + 1, 0) }
  (0..n).each do |i|
    (0..capacity).each do |w|
      if i == 0 || w == 0
        dp[i][w] = 0
      elsif weights[i - 1] <= w
        dp[i][w] = [dp[i - 1][w], values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]]].max
      else
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]
      end
    end
  end
  dp[n][capacity]
end
```

**Improvements:**
- Fixed missing parenthesis in function definition.
- Adjusted DP table to `n + 1` rows and `capacity + 1` columns.
- Fixed loop to use `i - 1` for values and weights to avoid index errors.
- Used `each` for idiomatic iteration.
