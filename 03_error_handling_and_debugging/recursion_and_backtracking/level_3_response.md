You're working with a **Ruby implementation of the N-Queens problem**, but there are multiple bugs and inefficiencies in the code. Let’s go step-by-step to **analyze** and **fix** everything, categorizing each problem into **syntax**, **logic**, **runtime**, or **semantic** errors.

---

## ✅ Objective
Place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

---

## 🔍 ANALYSIS & FIXES

### 1. ❌ **Syntax Error** in `def is_safe(board, row, col)`
```ruby
def is_safe(board, row, col)
```
✅ **Fix**: Add missing `end` of method and replace `=` with `==` in conditionals.

---

### 2. ❌ **Incorrect Use of `board.length` in Ruby**
Ruby uses `.length`, not `.length` for arrays — **OK** here.

But here's the key **logic inefficiency**:

```ruby
# Recalculate expensive operations for every check
valid_positions = []

# O(n²) calculation of all valid positions on the board
n = board.length
n.times do |r|
  n.times do |c|
    ...
```

🚫 **Problem**: You're recalculating all valid positions for **every single cell** in the board for each call to `is_safe`. This is extremely inefficient (O(n⁴)).

✅ **Fix**: Instead of this, use the **standard check** for placing a queen at a given position:

```ruby
def is_safe(board, row, col)
  (0...row).each do |i|
    return false if board[i] == col || 
                    (board[i] - i).abs == (col - row).abs
  end
  true
end
```

📌 **Type**: **Logic error** and **performance issue**

---

### 3. ❌ **Incorrect Handling of Base Case in Small n**
```ruby
if n <= 3 && n > 1
  if row == n
    solutions << board.dup
  end
  return
end
```

🚫 Problem: This will **prevent correct solutions from being added** for `n = 2` or `3`, which is already impossible.

✅ Fix: Remove this check altogether. Just rely on the core recursive logic.

📌 **Type**: Logic error

---

### 4. ❌ **Incorrect `print_board` Function**

#### Issues:
```ruby
n.times do |j + 1|  # Syntax error
  if board[i] = j   # Assignment, not comparison
```

✅ Fix:
```ruby
def print_board(board)
  n = board.length
  n.times do |i|
    n.times do |j|
      if board[i] == j
        print "Q "
      else
        print ". "
      end
    end
    puts
  end
  puts
end
```

📌 **Type**: **Syntax error** and **logic error**

### ✅ FINAL FIXED VERSION

```ruby
def is_safe(board, row, col)
  (0...row).each do |i|
    return false if board[i] == col || 
                    (board[i] - i).abs == (col - row).abs
  end
  true
end

def solve_n_queens_util(board, row, solutions)
  n = board.length
  if row == n
    solutions << board.clone
    return
  end

  (0...n).each do |col|
    if is_safe(board, row, col)
      board[row] = col
      solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, solutions)
      board[row] = -1
    end
  end
end

def solve_n_queens(n)
  board = Array.new(n, -1)
  solutions = []
  solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, solutions)
  solutions
end

def print_board(board)
  n = board.length
  n.times do |i|
    n.times do |j|
      if board[i] == j
        print "Q "
      else
        print ". "
      end
    end
    puts
  end
  puts
end

# Main
if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME
  require 'benchmark'

  n = 8
  time = Benchmark.measure do
    @solutions = solve_n_queens(n)
  end

  puts "Found #{@solutions.length} solutions for #{n}-Queens problem"
  puts "Time taken: #{time.real.round(6)} seconds\n\n"

  unless @solutions.empty?
    puts "First solution:"
    print_board(@solutions[0])
  end
end
```

|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------|
| Recomputing valid positions in `is_safe`    | Logic/Runtime| ✅     |
