Sure! Let's break this into **two parts**:

## üîç Part 1: Review the Provided Code for N-Queens in Ruby

You're trying to solve the **N-Queens** problem in Ruby, but the code has **multiple issues**, including:

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues (Buggy Code Breakdown)

### 1. **Syntax Error in `is_safe` method**
```ruby
def is_safe(board, row, col)
```
You're missing a `do` or `{}` after `0...row`:
```ruby
(0...row).each do |i|
```

Also, your method is not properly indented and is missing an `end` keyword before `true`.

---

### 2. **Wrong range in `solve_n_queens_util`**
```ruby
(0..n).each do |col|
```
Ruby ranges are **inclusive** with `..`, so this gives index `n`, which is out of bounds. You should use:
```ruby
(0...n).each do |col|
```

---

### 3. **Typo in variable name**
```ruby
solutons = []
```
This should be:
```ruby
solutions = []
```

---

### 4. **String interpolation error**
```ruby
puts "Time taken:" #{time.real.round(6)} seconds\n\n"
```
You can't mix static strings and interpolation like this. Should be:
```ruby
puts "Time taken: #{time.real.round(6)} seconds\n\n"
```

---

### 5. **Incorrect `is_safe` return logic**
```ruby
    return false
  end
  true
```
You forgot an `end` before `true`. Fix:
```ruby
    return false
  end
  true
end
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Corrected & Working Ruby Code

```ruby
def is_safe(board, row, col)
  (0...row).each do |i|
    if board[i] == col || # Same column
       board[i] - i == col - row || # Same diagonal \
       board[i] + i == col + row # Same diagonal /
      return false
    end
  end
  true
end

def solve_n_queens_util(board, row, solutions)
  n = board.length
  if row == n
    solutions << board.dup
    return
  end

  (0...n).each do |col|
    if is_safe(board, row, col)
      board[row] = col
      solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, solutions)
      board[row] = -1 # Backtrack
    end
  end
end

def solve_n_queens(n)
  board = Array.new(n, -1)
  solutions = []
  solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, solutions)
  solutions
end

def print_board(board)
  n = board.length
  n.times do |i|
    n.times do |j|
      print(board[i] == j ? "Q " : ". ")
    end
    puts
  end
  puts
end

# Main Program
if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME
  require 'benchmark'

  n = 8
  time = Benchmark.measure do
    @solutions = solve_n_queens(n)
  end

  puts "Found #{@solutions.length} solutions for #{n}-Queens problem"
  puts "Time taken: #{time.real.round(6)} seconds\n\n"

  unless @solutions.empty?
    puts "First solution:"
    print_board(@solutions[0])
  end
end
```

## üß† Bug Summary

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Syntax** | Missing `do` for block, missing `end`, invalid interpolation |
| **Logic** | Incorrect range `(0..n)` instead of `(0...n)` |
| **Semantic** | Typo in variable `solutons` |
| **Runtime** | `IndexError` if `col == n` |
| **Usability** | Output formatting issues |
