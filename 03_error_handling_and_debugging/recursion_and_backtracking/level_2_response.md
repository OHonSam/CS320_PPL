Absolutely! Let's go through your updated **Ruby code** for the **N-Queens** problem and identify the **bugs** and **issues**.

## 🧠 Quick Overview of the Goal

You're solving the classic **N-Queens problem** where you place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other (i.e., not in same row, column, or diagonal).

## 🐞 Buggy Code Analysis (What’s Wrong and Why)

### 1. ❌ `is_safe` Return Value Is Flipped (⚠️ Logic Error)

```ruby
if board[i] == col || 
   board[i] - i == col - row || 
   board[i] + i == col + row
  return true
end
```

- ❗This says **"return true" if it's NOT safe** — that's **completely opposite** of the intended logic.
- ✅ **Fix:** Return **false** if it's under attack, and return **true** only after checking all.

#### ✅ Fixed:
```ruby
def is_safe(board, row, col)
  (0...row).each do |i|
    if board[i] == col || 
       board[i] - i == col - row || 
       board[i] + i == col + row
      return false
    end
  end
  true
end
```

---

### 2. ❌ Recursive Call Doesn't Advance to Next Row (⚠️ Logic Error)

```ruby
solve_n_queens_util(board, row, solutions)
```

- ❗You're recursively calling with the **same `row`**, which causes an infinite loop.
- ✅ You must move to the next row: `row + 1`

#### ✅ Fixed:
```ruby
solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, solutions)
```

---

### 3. ❌ Board State Shared in Solutions (⚠️ Runtime/Semantics Error)

```ruby
solutions << board
```

- ❗This appends a **reference** to the same `board` object every time, which keeps changing due to backtracking.
- ✅ You need to append a **deep copy** using `board.dup`.

#### ✅ Fixed:
```ruby
solutions << board.dup
```

---

### 4. ❌ Print Board Logic is Transposed (⚠️ Semantics)

```ruby
if board[j] == i
```

- ❗You're checking `board[j] == i`, which is flipping rows and columns.
- ✅ You should use `board[i] == j`.

#### ✅ Fixed:
```ruby
if board[i] == j
```

## ✅ Fully Fixed Version of Your Code

```ruby
def is_safe(board, row, col)
  (0...row).each do |i|
    if board[i] == col || 
       board[i] - i == col - row || 
       board[i] + i == col + row
      return false
    end
  end
  true
end

def solve_n_queens_util(board, row, solutions)
  n = board.length
  if row == n
    solutions << board.dup
    return
  end

  (0...n).each do |col|
    if is_safe(board, row, col)
      board[row] = col
      solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, solutions)
      board[row] = -1
    end
  end
end

def solve_n_queens(n)
  board = Array.new(n, -1)
  solutions = []
  solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, solutions)
  solutions
end

def print_board(board)
  n = board.length
  n.times do |i|
    n.times do |j|
      if board[i] == j
        print "Q "
      else
        print ". "
      end
    end
    puts
  end
  puts
end

# Main program
if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME
  require 'benchmark'

  n = 8
  time = Benchmark.measure do
    @solutions = solve_n_queens(n)
  end

  puts "Found #{@solutions.length} solutions for #{n}-Queens problem"
  puts "Time taken: #{time.real.round(6)} seconds\n\n"

  unless @solutions.empty?
    puts "First solution:"
    print_board(@solutions[0])
  end
end
```
