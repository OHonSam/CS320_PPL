**Issues:**
- **Syntax error**: `else if` should be `elsif` in Ruby.
- **Off-by-one error**: `right = arr.length` sets `right` to one past the last index, causing `arr[mid]` to access out-of-bounds when `mid = arr.length`. It should be `arr.length - 1`.
- **Logic error**: When `arr[mid] < target`, `left = mid` doesn’t exclude `mid`, potentially causing an infinite loop. It should be `left = mid + 1`.
- **Indentation**: Inconsistent indentation in the `while` loop makes the code harder to read.

**Explanation:**
The binary search algorithm fails due to incorrect boundary initialization and update logic. Setting `right` to `arr.length` risks out-of-bounds access, and not adjusting `left` properly can cause infinite loops. Ruby’s `elsif` is required for proper conditional syntax.

**Corrected Code:**
```ruby
def binary_search(arr, target)
  left = 0
  right = arr.length - 1
  while left <= right
    mid = (left + right) / 2
    if arr[mid] == target
      return mid
    elsif arr[mid] < target
      left = mid + 1
    else
      right = mid - 1
    end
  end
  -1
end
```

**Improvements:**
- Fixed `right` to `arr.length - 1` to prevent out-of-bounds access.
- Changed `else if` to `elsif`.
- Updated `left` to `mid + 1` to exclude `mid`.
- Improved indentation for clarity.
