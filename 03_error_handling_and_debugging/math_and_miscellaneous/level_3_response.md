You're right—this Prolog snippet for checking prime numbers has multiple issues. Let's walk through what it's trying to do, identify the bugs, categorize the error types, and then fix it.

### 🔍 Original Code (Buggy)
```prolog
% Checks if a number N is prime
is_prime(N) :-
    N > 2,
    \+ has_divisor(2, N).

% Succeeds if N has a divisor D such that D*D <= N
has_divisor(N, D) :-
    D < N,
    (N mod D =:= 0 ; D1 is D + D, has_divisor(N, D1)).
```

---

## 🧠 Intended Logic
- `is_prime(N)` checks if `N` is a prime number by verifying that it has **no divisors** other than 1 and itself.
- `has_divisor(D, N)` recursively checks if any number `D` such that `2 ≤ D ≤ sqrt(N)` divides `N`.

---

## ❌ Problems and Types of Errors

### 1. **Incorrect Argument Order in `has_divisor/2`**  
- **Bug**: `has_divisor(N, D)` is written with the wrong argument order compared to how it’s called in `is_prime/1`: `has_divisor(2, N)`.  
- **Type**: Logic Error  
- **Fix**: Either reorder the arguments or fix the call. The correct call should match the definition.

---

### 2. **Incorrect Recursion Step in `has_divisor`**
```prolog
D1 is D + D
```
- **Bug**: This doubles `D` instead of incrementing by 1.
- **Type**: Logic Error  
- **Fix**: Change to `D1 is D + 1`

---

### 3. **Wrong Use of Base Condition**
- **Bug**: The code lacks a **base case** to stop recursion when `D * D > N`.
- **Type**: Logic / Runtime Error (leads to infinite recursion)
- **Fix**: Add `D * D > N` condition to stop checking beyond square root of `N`.

---

### 4. **Wrong Boundary Check in `is_prime/1`**
```prolog
N > 2
```
- **Bug**: This incorrectly excludes 2, which *is* prime.
- **Type**: Logic Error  
- **Fix**: Use `N >= 2`

---

## ✅ Fixed & Clean Version

```prolog
% Checks if a number N is prime
is_prime(N) :-
    N >= 2,
    \+ has_divisor(N, 2).

% has_divisor(N, D) succeeds if N has a divisor D, starting from 2 up to sqrt(N)
has_divisor(N, D) :-
    D * D =< N,
    (N mod D =:= 0 ;
     D1 is D + 1,
     has_divisor(N, D1)).
```

## ✅ Summary of Fixes

| Problem                             | Type         | Fix                                   |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Wrong argument order                | Logic        | Reordered `has_divisor/2` arguments     |
| Doubling instead of incrementing   | Logic        | Changed `D + D` → `D + 1`               |
| No base case                       | Logic/Runtime| Added `D*D =< N` as condition           |
| Incorrect prime condition on 2     | Logic        | Used `N >= 2` instead of `N > 2`        |
