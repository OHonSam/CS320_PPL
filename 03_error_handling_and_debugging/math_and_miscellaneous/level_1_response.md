You're working on Prolog code to check whether a number is **prime**, but there are several issues in your code. Let's go through the provided code line-by-line, **identify the bugs**, and explain how to fix them.

---

### ❌ Buggy Code

```prolog
% Checks if a number N is prime
is_prime(N) 
    N > 1,
    \+ has_divisor(N, 2).

% Succeeds if N has a divisor D such that D*D <= N
has_divisor(N, D) :-
    D * D =< N,
    (N mod D =:= 0 ; D1 is D + 1, has_divisr(N, D1)).
```

---

### ✅ Let's go through the errors step-by-step:

---

#### 🐞 Error 1: **Missing `:-` in `is_prime/1` definition**
- **Line:** `is_prime(N)`  
- **Issue:** This is a **syntax error**. A Prolog rule must have `:-` between the head and body.
- **Fix:** Change to:
  ```prolog
  is_prime(N) :-
  ```

---

#### 🐞 Error 2: **Typo in predicate name `has_divisr/2`**
- **Line:** `has_divisr(N, D1)`
- **Issue:** This is a **runtime error** or **logic error**. You call `has_divisr`, but you defined `has_divisor`.
- **Fix:** Change to:
  ```prolog
  has_divisor(N, D1)
  ```

---

#### 🐞 Error 3: **Use of `*` operator directly (e.g., `D * D`)**
- **Line:** `D * D =< N`
- **Issue:** This is a **syntax and runtime error**. You can't write arithmetic expressions directly in comparisons in Prolog — use `is/2` to evaluate expressions.
- **Fix:** Use a temporary variable:
  ```prolog
  Dsq is D * D,
  Dsq =< N,
  ```

### ✅ Fixed and Cleaned Up Code

```prolog
% Checks if a number N is prime
is_prime(N) :-
    N > 1,
    \+ has_divisor(N, 2).

% Succeeds if N has a divisor D such that D*D =< N
has_divisor(N, D) :-
    D * D =< N,
    (N mod D =:= 0 ; 
     D1 is D + 1,
     has_divisor(N, D1)).
```

Or more properly using `is/2`:

```prolog
is_prime(N) :-
    N > 1,
    \+ has_divisor(N, 2).

has_divisor(N, D) :-
    Dsq is D * D,
    Dsq =< N,
    (N mod D =:= 0 ;
     D1 is D + 1,
     has_divisor(N, D1)).
```

### 🧠 Summary of Bug Types

| Bug | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Missing `:-` in `is_prime/1` | **Syntax** | All Prolog rules must have `:-` separating head from body |
| `has_divisr` typo | **Runtime / Logic** | Wrong predicate name causes failure or "undefined predicate" error |
| `D * D =< N` used directly | **Syntax / Runtime** | Arithmetic expressions must be evaluated using `is/2` before comparisons |
