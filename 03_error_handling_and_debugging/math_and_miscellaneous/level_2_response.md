You're right — the Prolog code you posted is intended to determine whether a number is **prime**, but it contains several **logic and semantic errors** that prevent it from working correctly. Let's walk through the code step by step to understand what it's doing, identify what’s wrong, and then fix it.

### 🔎 Original Code

```prolog
% Checks if a number N is prime
is_prime(N) :-
    N >= 1,
    \+ has_divisor(N, 1).

% Succeeds if N has a divisor D such that D*D <= N
has_divisor(N, D) :-
    D * D < N,
    (N mod D =:= 1 ; D1 is D + 1, has_divisor(N, D1)).
```

## ❌ Problems in the Code

### 1. **Incorrect Starting Point for Divisor Checking**
   - In `is_prime/1`, you call `has_divisor(N, 1)`.
   - But **1 divides every number**, so starting at 1 will always find a "divisor" — even for prime numbers.
   - ✅ Instead, we should **start from 2** when checking for divisors.

---

### 2. **Incorrect Divisibility Check**
   - `N mod D =:= 1` is incorrect.
   - It checks whether `N mod D == 1`, meaning N leaves a remainder of 1 — but for divisibility, we want `N mod D =:= 0`.
   - ✅ We should check: `N mod D =:= 0` to find a true divisor.

---

### 3. **Wrong Prime Number Lower Bound**
   - The check `N >= 1` is too lenient.
   - ✅ The smallest prime number is **2**. So we should check `N >= 2`.

---

### 4. **Logical Structure of `has_divisor`**
   - You wrote this:
     ```prolog
     (N mod D =:= 1 ; D1 is D + 1, has_divisor(N, D1)).
     ```
     - This means: if `N mod D =:= 1`, *OR* recurse. But the condition is wrong, and it's unclear.
   - ✅ Correct structure: check if divisible (`mod D =:= 0`) — if so, it has a divisor, so fail. Otherwise, increment D and keep checking.

---

## ✅ Fixed Version

```prolog
% Checks if a number N is prime
is_prime(N) :-
    N >= 2,
    \+ has_divisor(N, 2).

% Succeeds if N has a divisor D such that D*D =< N
has_divisor(N, D) :-
    D * D =< N,
    (N mod D =:= 0 ;
     D1 is D + 1,
     has_divisor(N, D1)).
```

## ✅ Example Usage

```prolog
?- is_prime(7).
true.

?- is_prime(10).
false.

?- is_prime(2).
true.
```

## 🔍 Error Summary

| Error Type     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logic Error    | Starting divisor from 1 — causes wrong results for all inputs               |
| Semantic Error | Wrong check: `N mod D =:= 1` instead of `N mod D =:= 0`                     |
| Semantic Error | `N >= 1` allows non-prime values like 1, which isn’t prime                  |
| Logic Error    | Incorrect use of disjunction for control flow in `has_divisor/2`            |
