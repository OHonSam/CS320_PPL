**Issues:**
- **Syntax error**: Assignment if `slow = fast` should be comparison `if slow == fast`.
- **Logic error**: `fast = fast.next.next.next` moves fast three steps, which is incorrect for Floyd’s cycle detection (should be two steps).
- **Case error**: `return False` uses Python-style `False` instead of Ruby’s `false`.
- **Redundant check**: `head.next.nil?` in the initial check is sufficient; `head.nil?` is redundant since `head.next` handles it.
- **Performance**: The algorithm is correct in principle but broken due to the above errors.

**Explanation:**
The cycle detection uses Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm but fails due to a mistaken assignment (`=` instead of `==`), incorrect step size for `fast`, and a Python-style boolean. These errors prevent correct cycle detection.

**Corrected Code:**
```ruby
class ListNode
  attr_accessor :val, :next
  def initialize(val)
    @val = val
    @next = nil
  end
end

def has_cycle(head)
  return false if head.nil? || head.next.nil?
  slow = head
  fast = head
  while fast && fast.next
    return true if slow == fast
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
  end
  false
end
```

**Improvements:**
- Changed `slow = fast` to `slow == fast`.
- Fixed `fast` to move two steps (`fast.next.next`).
- Changed `False` to `false`.
- Simplified initial check to `head.nil? || head.next.nil?`.
