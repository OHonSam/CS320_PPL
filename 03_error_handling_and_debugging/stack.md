**Issues:**
- **Syntax error**: Missing closing parenthesis in `push(item`.
- **Variable typo**: In `peek`, `items[-1]` should be `@items[-1]`.
- **Incomplete functionality**: The stack lacks methods like `empty?` or `size`, which are common for a stack implementation.
- **Return statements**: Explicit `return` in `pop` and `peek` is unnecessary in Ruby for simple expressions.

**Explanation:**
The stack implementation has a `syntax error` in `push` and a `typo` in `peek`, making it non-functional. While minimal, it could benefit from additional utility methods for completeness.

**Corrected Code:**
```ruby
class Stack
  def initialize
    @items = []
  end

  def push(item)
    @items << item
  end

  def pop
    @items.pop
  end

  def peek
    @items[-1]
  end

  def empty?
    @items.empty?
  end

  def size
    @items.length
  end
end
```

**Improvements:**
- Fixed missing parenthesis in `push`.
- Corrected `items` to `@items` in `peek`.
- Added `empty?` and `size` methods for completeness.
- Removed unnecessary return statements for idiomatic Ruby.
